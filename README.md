# Self-taught Data Structures & Algorithms

Is LeetCode too hard? It's because you lack the fundamentals to tackle such problems.

This repo will be a collection of problems, homework, concepts and theory from various courses taught by top institutions teaching Computer Science.

By the end of going through these courses, one should be proficient in tackling data structures and algorithm related problems.

# Courses

## Foundations
1. [UC Berkeley CS 61A](https://github.com/leejianping/cs61A-Spring2024) ✅
    - only completed weeks 1-8
    - I think after week 8 is redundant and not really related to DSA
    - probably worth completing if I didn't get too bored
2. [UC Berkeley CS 61B](https://fa24.datastructur.es/) ⏳

# Disclaimer

I'm currently going through these courses myself in order to properly learn the fundamentals before tackling LeetCode.
Though these are not the latest cutting-edge frameworks and concepts in software, having a solid grasp of what will be learned here will be applicable anywhere.

## Language of choice

I will be using Python 3 as the primary language to not be bogged down by language overhead allowing one to focus solely on the concepts.

## Usage of A.I.

On some problem sets, I will include the implementation of some LLMs, primarily ChatGPT 4o.

Let's face it, in this age of LLM hype, usage of LLMs are unavoidable. They can provide insights and approaches to problems that we otherwise wouldn't have thought of.

Let's embrace the value they provide, not as a shortcut, but as a way to improve our thinking.
