# Unfortunately...

...I'll have to skip this project. I think it would've been fun to work on it but it's just not worth the time trying to get IDE-based projects to work outside of UC Berkeley's course environments.

I've gotten really close trying to convert this project to use Maven but it turns out that there's dependencies on UC Berkeley libraries that I have no access to.
